Prototype for android banking application

Native android application created for "Gestion de projets en g√©nie logiciel" (Software Project Managment)

Text is in French, "messages" from the bank are a French themed lorem ipsum. Application was made as a rapid prototype to simulate demonstrating to the client what it would look like. No actual functionality beyond EditText input type restrictions (map is an image, not map view, doesn;t have backend etc.) Needs appcompat_v7
